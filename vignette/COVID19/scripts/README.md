These scripts were used to make chemoinformatic predictions for the set
of proteomic targets identified to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins
in (Gordon, et al., 2020).

It builds on the BioChemPantry R package (github.com/maomlab/BioChemPantry)
which prepares biology and chemistry datasets into a Postgres database
to facilitate merging using the R tidyverse framework.

# Running the code
Using the BioChemPantry run the vignettes to setup the following datasets
    * hgnc_171217
    * sea_chembl25
    * guide_to_pharmacology_2020_03

From the directory containing raw_data/, intermediate_data/, scripts/, and product/
run the scripts in scripts/ sequentially.
